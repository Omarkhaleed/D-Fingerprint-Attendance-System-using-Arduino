## General Information
- This System aims to make the process more efficiency and automated which can do by take Fingerprint and some data from user or employee to contact the   Manager or Administrator directly which donâ€™t need paper or employee to can do this job which we can this process from manual to digital process.

- It consists of three modules: micro control-based system, web API, and user GUI web interface to interact with the system through web GUI and micro     control-system peripherals to achieve system usability and user-friendly experience

## Technologies Used
- Front End - HTML5 , CSS3 , Bootstrap , React.js
- Back End and Hardware - Python , Flask , PostgreSQL , Arduino C , Fingerprint sensor ,REST web service
 

## Features
- Manage attendance in an automated manner
- Organize attendance in a hierarchal form to provide efficient representation
- take Fingerprint and some data from user or employee to contact the Manager or Administrator directly
